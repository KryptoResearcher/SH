# Research Statement & Roadmap

## Nature of This Implementation

This codebase is a **research implementation** of the Semantic Holder (SH) primitive. Its primary purposes are:
1.  To validate the theoretical concepts presented in the accompanying paper.
2.  To provide a concrete, executable specification for the SH construction.
3.  To serve as a testbed for experimenting with parameters and evaluating performance.
4.  To enable the research community to scrutinize, critique, and build upon the work.

## Current Limitations

*   **Performance:** The current Python implementation is a prototype. It is not optimized for performance and is unsuitable for processing large volumes of data or using the large parameters required for real-world security.
*   **STARK Integration:** Integration with a production-grade STARK prover is a complex task and is currently simulated/placeholder.
*   **Legal Accuracy:** The provided legal contexts and verdict spaces are simplified examples for demonstration. They do not constitute accurate legal advice or represent real-world legal frameworks.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Python Prototype (Current)
- [x] Define core data structures (`LegalTrace`, `SHParameters`).
- [x] Implement finite field arithmetic and AIIP iteration.
- [x] Implement the semantic mapping function `Ï†`.
- [x] Create pedagogical examples.
- [ ] Integrate with a simple STARK proof system (e.g., a basic Winterfell example).

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile the Python code to identify bottlenecks.
- [ ] Migrate performance-critical components (AIIP iteration) to **Rust**.
- [ ] Create Python bindings for the Rust code.
- [ ] Publish definitive performance benchmarks.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Evaluation
- [ ] Develop more sophisticated legal rule engines.
- [ ] Conduct a formal security audit of the implementation.
- [ ] Perform a case study applying SH to a specific, narrow legal domain.
