# Theory: SH Primitive Overview

The Semantic Holder (SH) is the opposability layer of the broader CASH framework. It solves a core problem: how can a cryptographic output also be a legally valid and opposable interpretation?

## Core Idea: Algebraic Extraction

SH works by performing a one-way algebraic computation on an input (typically a hash) and then mapping the final result to a legally meaningful verdict.

The high-level workflow is:
1.  **Input:** A pre-image `h` (e.g., a hash of a contract or document).
2.  **Iteration:** Compute the AIIP function iteratively: `Trace = [h, f(h), f²(h), ..., fⁿ(h)]`.
3.  **Mapping:** Apply the semantic mapping function `φ` to the final element `fⁿ(h)` to extract a verdict from a predefined space `V_J`.
4.  **Explanation & Proof:** Generate a institution-specific explanation and a STARK proof `π` that certifies the entire computation was performed correctly.

## Key Properties

1.  **Minimum Opposability Bound:** The primary guarantee. Every valid interpretation `L` generated by SH must have an opposability score `Ω(L) ≥ 0.60`.
2.  **Institutional Explainability:** SH can generate different explanations for the same verdict, tailored to the rules and frameworks of different legal institutions.
3.  **Legal Contestability:** The construction ensures pathways exist to contest an interpretation, and this is factored into the opposability score.
4.  **Verifiable Computation:** The use of STARK proofs allows anyone to verify that the interpretation was derived correctly from the input, without re-running the entire computation.
