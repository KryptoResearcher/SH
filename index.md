# Semantic Holder (SH) - Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Semantic Holder (SH) reference implementation. SH is a cryptographic primitive designed to provide **verifiable legal opposability** by transforming computational outputs into legally meaningful interpretations with mathematically proven guarantees.

## This is a Research Implementation

**Important:** This project is a **reference implementation** of a theoretical construct. It is intended for research, experimentation, and validation of the concepts presented in the accompanying academic paper. It is not yet audited or ready for production use.
